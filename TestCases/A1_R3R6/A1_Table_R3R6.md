### Test Plan:
1. Method to organize the documentation of test cases: 
  - One of the member created a folder named "TestCases"in our repository, and each of the member will create a subfolder that contains two markdown files: (1) the test cases written in human language (2) the markdown table that summarize the test case.

2. How the chosen testing frameworks to test the frontend, and when and how the test cases will be running directly on GitHub
  - The test has been separated into different specifications. For each of the specification developers are asked to test certain requirements which allows the user to do in the frontend and constraints which warn user not entering the wrong input.
  - The test case will be run each time when there is a required unit test and when there is a change for the test case. The test case can be run from the end of prototyping stage which enables the developers to review the test cases.

3. How to organize different test case code files? 
  - One of the member created a folder named "TestCases" in our repo, then for each of the member they will be asked to generate a subfolder that included certain requirement. Inside the subfolder, the member will generate the code file that is for certain specification.
